    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8">
    “The best way to understand the universe is through a forest wilderness,”
    once said renowned naturalist John Muir. Forests are more than mere
    resources to be sold, destroyed, and profited from. Beautiful living
    ecosystems, forests serve as a metaphor for both the best and worst of
    humanity. On one hand, forests embody the pinnacle of natural beauty and
    harmony. They are a testament to the intricate relations between countless
    species, each playing a role in maintaining the delicate balance of life.
    Just like how humans should coexist with nature, forests demonstrate the
    importance of unity and collaboration. Forests also symbolize resilience and
    adaptability. They have withstood the test of time, surviving through
    various environmental changes and disturbances. In this sense, they reflect
    humanity's ability to overcome challenges and evolve in the face of
    adversity. Forests teach us that even in the harshest conditions, life can
    thrive if we learn to adapt and work together. However, forests also
    highlight some of humanity's darkest tendencies. Throughout history, we have
    witnessed the destruction and exploitation of these precious ecosystems for
    our own selfish gains. Deforestation driven by greed, urbanization
    encroaching upon pristine wilderness, and unsustainable logging practices
    leading to the untimely demise of the forests. This quote, in my opinion,
    encapsulates our journey to Hyla Woods.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm m-0 pt-0">
    <strong>Narrative</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    On October 12th and 30th, our class had the privilege of visiting Hyla
    Woods, an 160-acre actively logged forest located west of Portland, near
    Forest Grove. This remarkable forest, owned by the Hayes family, serves as a
    proof-of-concept experimental site with the ambitious goal of being
    “ecologically complex, economically viable, and responsibly operated.”<sup
        >2</sup
    >
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Hyla Woods distinguishes itself from conventional logging operations through
    a fundamental difference in approach. In the realm of timber production,
    clear-cutting has emerged as the prevailing and profit-driven method,
    characterized by the harvesting of robust natural forests and replacement
    with artificial, monoculture tree plantations that fail to emulate the
    invaluable ecosystem services of a thriving woodland. On the contrary, Peter
    and Pam Hayes adopt a distinct and conscientious approach in the management
    of Hyla Woods. Their practices involve selective cutting, with a focus on
    smaller trees and an objective to preserve a diverse array of tree species.
    Additionally, they abstain from employing poison sprays following a harvest,
    prioritizing the integrity and health of their land and its surrounding
    environment.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    During our visit, we had the opportunity to collect valuable data from the
    stream, focusing on various variables such as pH levels, dissolved oxygen
    (DO), water and air temperature, turbidity, and benthic macroinvertebrates.
    We collected this data on both visits (with the exception of benthic
    macroinvertebrates) from 12 different field sites along the creek, with the
    objective to assess the overall salubrity of the creek and its capacity to
    support the diverse life found within, with a particular emphasis on Coast
    Coho salmon. These salmon are a threatened species that spawn only in small
    mountain streams, ones similar to Lousignont Creek in Hyla Woods.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8">
    Our work at Hyla Woods was driven by four foundational questions: What
    defines a system and how does it function? How do organisms influence one
    another and their surrounding environment? How does energy and matter
    circulate within an ecosystem? And, most importantly, how can we determine
    the health of an ecosystem?
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    The recent investigation fostered significant learning outcomes related to
    scientific practices and cross-cutting concepts. As evidenced by the
    alignment with numerous Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), the work
    meaningfully advanced our understanding of science.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Specifically, the activities connected to NGSS Practice 1 by seeking answers
    to core questions, especially “How can we determine the health of an
    ecosystem?” Substantial planning and two days of fieldwork at Hyla Woods
    aligned with Practice 3. Practice 4 was engaged through analytical
    evaluation of the collected data to draw conclusions. Practices 5 and 6
    respectively involved applying mathematical analysis to the data collection
    and constructing explanations based on results. Communication and evaluation
    of test outcomes with the landowners for stewardship purposes embodied
    Practice 8.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Several cross-cutting concepts were also engaged. Repeated water testing to
    identify patterns coincided with Concept 1. The various data collected
    exemplified Concept 3. Investigation of the Hyla Woods system demonstrated
    Concept 4. Aspiring to understand ecosystem stability over time related to
    Concept 7.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8">
    Beyond just the immense ramifications of in-class learning, this work is not
    limited to our science classroom in the slightest. Our research contributes
    to helping the Hayes family continually manage the forest sustainably, and
    to protect the Coast Coho Salmon that spawn in the Nehalem watershed. The
    implications of the research conducted by the science classroom extend far
    beyond the bounds of traditional in-class learning. The work performed not
    only enhances our educational experience, but also yields tangible benefits
    for environmental protection and sustainable management in the local
    community. Through collaborating with the Hayes family on analysis of their
    forest land, we were able to aid ongoing stewardship efforts to ensure the
    responsible and long-term utilization of this vital natural resource.
    Moreover, the watershed research focused on the endangered Coast Coho Salmon
    demonstrates how knowledge gained within the classroom walls can directly
    assist local wildlife. By understanding some of the factors influencing the
    salmon that spawn in the Nehalem watershed, we enhance monitoring of the
    watershed conditions and pinpoint any emerging threats, thereby supporting
    measures to safeguard these important fish and the long-term viability of
    the species.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Wild Salmon Strongholds are a vital component for the health of salmon. As
    discussed in class, these areas allow salmon populations to exist unaffected
    by human impacts and activities, thereby ensuring the long-term viability
    and sustainability of the species. One such stronghold is Hyla Woods. As one
    of the remaining places where salmon can thrive in their natural habitat
    without interference, it is imperative that Hyla Woods maintains its
    favorable conditions. The interconnected relationship between forests and
    streams lies at the core of the region's ecological integrity. As we
    learned, these natural systems are inextricably linked - the forests help
    regulate water flows and quality, while the streams transport nutrients into
    the woods. A disruption to either can gravely harm the other.<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8">
    For Hyla Woods, the connections between overland and instream environments
    are evident. With its woodlands directly adjacent to salmon-bearing
    waterways, the area provides salmon with optimal spawning grounds, shelter
    from predators and food sources. The forest canopy shades the streams,
    regulating water temperatures needed by salmon. Leaf litter and woody debris
    from the trees fall into the creeks, creating habitat complexity.<sup>4</sup

    <strong>Tests and Results</strong>
</p>

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 pt-0">
    Water temperature is a measurement of the kinetic energy, or movement of
    molecules, within a body of water. Determining water temperature accurately
    is an important factor when assessing the health of aquatic ecosystems. For
    our analysis, we used a thermometer to gauge the temperature in several
    locations of the creek over the course of two minutes. To obtain a
    representative reading, we took measurements at three different spots within
    the waterway and then calculated the average of these results. Temperature
    recordings are vital for understanding the well-being of the creek
    environment, especially as it pertains to sensitive species such as Coast
    Coho Salmon. As ectothermic animals, salmon cannot internally regulate their
    body heat and rely entirely on ambient water temperatures. If temperatures
    rise too high, it can quickly become fatal for these cold-blooded fish.
    Conversely, temperatures that fall too low risk freezing the salmon. Most
    aquatic flora and fauna thrive when water temperatures are within a range of
    5 to 25 degrees Celsius. After completing two rounds of systematic testing
    at our field sites, the average temperature we observed was 10.9 degrees
    Celsius.<sup>5</sup>

<p class="text-white text-center font-mono text-base">
    <em>Fig. 3.</em> Alexy Heston, Conducting Turbidity Test: 12 Oct 2023.
</p>

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 pt-0">
    Turbidity is a measure of water cloudiness and an indicator of how much
    light can pass through the water. We assessed turbidity levels by collecting
    creek water samples in a specialized tube containing a checkerboard pattern
    at the bottom, known as a turbidity tube. The sample water was slowly
    released from the tube until the pattern became visible, at which point we
    recorded the depth of water in centimeters. This measurement was then
    converted to Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU), a standardized scale
    quantifying the amount of suspended solids in the water. Suspended sediment
    concentrations impact creek health through several mechanisms. Highly turbid
    water reduces sunlight penetration, potentially burying aquatic organisms.
    It can also increase water temperatures by limiting sunlight absorption.
    Reduced dissolved oxygen levels may occur due to lower photosynthetic
    activity. Suspended particles risk becoming trapped in fish gills. Organisms
    may face difficulties locating prey and avoiding predators with lower
    visibility. Elevated turbidity can also promote algal growth. For salmonids,
    an ideal turbidity is generally considered to be below 25 NTU. After
    collecting samples from twelve field sites on two occasions, our average
    turbidity readings were less than 5 NTU.<sup>6</sup>

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 pt-0">
    Dissolved Oxygen (DO) refers to the diatomic oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)
    molecules that are dissolved in an aqueous solution (H2O). We tested the
    concentration of dissolved oxygen by again taking a water sample from the
    creek and adding several chemicals to it. This test was not performed in the
    field directly, rather the water sample was transported back to our
    classroom science laboratory where the chemical procedures were executed
    after the gaseous oxygen was fixed (trapped) by earlier chemical reactions
    of the three initial reagents. Through a series of chemical reactions, this
    test process isolated the oxygen molecules that had been dissolved in the
    water sample and transformed them into a form that could be quantified and
    measured using analytical instrumentation. We were measuring the actual
    amount of oxygen gas present in molecular solution within the water,
    expressed in units of milligrams per liter (mg/L), also shown in parts per
    million (ppm), which is critically important for various aquatic lifeforms.
    For example, salmon and trout respire by extracting dissolved oxygen from
    the water through their gills, so they require a minimum concentration range
    of approximately 8-12 ppm DO for health and survival. Concentrations
    exceeding this threshold range are also suitable to support robust aquatic
    ecosystems. After systematically conducting tests on water samples procured
    from the twelve distinct locations along the creek, we determined that the
    average dissolved oxygen concentration observed across both sites was 9.0
    mg/L, which is equal to 9.0 ppm.

</p>

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 pt-0">
    pH is the measure of the concentration of hydroxyl ions (OH-) compared to
    hydrogen ions (H+) in an aqueous solution. A solution in which there is a
    higher concentration of hydrogen ions than hydroxyl ions is considered
    acidic, whereas a solution with a higher concentration of hydroxyl ions than
    hydrogen ions is considered basic. We conducted pH testing on a sample of
    creek water to determine its acidity level and suitability for salmon
    habitat. The testing was performed by adding various chemical reagents to
    aliquots of the water sample in order to alter the solution concentration
    and induce a color change reaction. The resultant coloration of each test
    mixture was then compared to a calibrated color scale. This colorimetric
    comparison method allowed us to determine the corresponding numerical pH
    value for the creek water. Most Pacific salmon species have been shown to
    thrive in freshwater with a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0, though a pH of around
    7.0 is considered optimal for salmon health and productivity. With this pH
    tolerance range in mind, we systematically tested water samples collected
    from two separate locations along the creek on multiple occasions. The pH
    was measured at each site and the average values were calculated. After
    completing pH testing at the field sites, we determined that the average pH
    observed in the creek water was 6.4.

    We tested the amount of benthic macroinvertebrates present in the creek
    water. On our initial visit, we placed a leaf pack in the water to allow
    colonization by macroinvertebrates. On the second visit, we removed the leaf
    pack and carefully brushed any macroinvertebrates from the leaves and other
    debris. We then identified and sorted the macroinvertebrates under a
    microscope according to predetermined classification groups. We counted the
    number of individuals in each group. This process allowed us to quantify the
    macroinvertebrate populations present by species.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    We then calculated both the Biotic Index and EPT Score for the site to
    evaluate water quality and ecosystem health. The Biotic Index is a measure
    of the average tolerance value of the macroinvertebrates present. We
    calculated this by first multiplying the count for each species by its
    respective Taxon Tolerance Level. We then summed these weighted counts and
    divided by the total number of individuals sampled. Generally speaking,
    sites with a lower Biotic Index (less than 3.75) indicate higher water
    quality and less organic pollution due to a community composition of more
    sensitive species.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    The EPT Score provides a measure of the relative abundance of certain
    pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrate orders - Ephemeroptera (Mayflies),
    Plecoptera (Stoneflies), and Trichoptera (Caddisflies). These three orders
    are considered to be among the most sensitive to pollution. We calculated
    the EPT Score by summing the counts of individuals from these three orders
    and dividing by the total count of all individuals sampled. This result was
    then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage. Higher EPT Scores
    (greater than 50%) are taken to indicate higher water quality.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8">
    We tested macroinvertebrate populations because their composition and
    relative abundances provide insight into the overall health of the aquatic
    ecosystem. The sensitivity and feeding groups represented can offer clues
    about factors like substrate composition, availability of food resources,
    and the ability of the site to support dependent wildlife. For example, a
    sample rich in shredders from a pool area with sandy substrate may suggest
    that area functions well as a retention zone for organic materials. The
    diversity of species sampled can also inform whether the site can sustain
    local amphibian, fish, bird and other populations.<sup>7,8</sup>

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm m-0 pt-0">
    <strong>Analysis and Conclusions</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 pt-0">
    The average water temperature we observed was 10.9 degrees Celsius. The
    adequate range for salmon health is between 5 to 25 degrees Celsius, with
    lower temperatures (5 to 13 degrees Celsius) generally being more
    beneficial. This data point fits comfortably within this ideal range. This
    indicates that the salmon will be kept at an optimal temperature, allowing
    them to reap the associated benefits, such as higher macroinvertebrate
    populations and avoidance of heat-related mortality. The average water
    temperature over the period from Fall 2016 to Fall 2023 is 9.502594697
    degrees Celsius.<sup>9</sup> This year's data point of 10.9 degrees Celsius is
    significantly higher than the long-term average temperature. However, this observation
    remains well within the ideal range for salmonid health. The water temperature
    has been rising steadily since 2019 based on our measurements. While this increasing
    trend is not currently a major cause of concern, as the rise has been slow and
    temperatures remain far from dangerous levels, it is a pattern that merits ongoing
    monitoring in the coming years. The water temperature at Hyla Woods has consistently
    been at a safe level throughout the duration of our testing. It continues to
    provide a suitable environment for salmon health. We should maintain surveillance
    of temperature readings to confirm this favorable condition persists.

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8">
    The average turbidity level we observed at our testing site was 5
    Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). The adequate turbidity range for salmon
    health and survival, as established by fisheries biologists and water
    quality experts, is less than 25 NTU, with lower cloudiness or turbidity
    levels being preferable. This particular data point of 5 NTU fits
    fantastically within the recommended turbidity range for salmon. This
    indicates that the salmon inhabiting the waters near our testing site will
    be experiencing an extremely healthy turbidity environment that avoids all
    of the potential issues and stressors that can arise when turbidity is at
    high levels. The average turbidity reading over the time period from Fall
    2016 to Fall 2023, encompassing the collective multiple testing events
    during that time frame, is 6.375 NTU. This year's data point of 5 NTU, is
    lower than the overall multi-year average turbidity. However, it is probable
    that the higher outliers observed in 2019 and 2020 skewed the long-term
    average upward somewhat. The turbidity level does appear to have been
    falling gradually since 2020 based on our measurements. Nonetheless, the
    downward trend is not necessarily statistically significant, as the
    fluctuations seem to have been primarily driven by those temporarily
    elevated turbidity readings in 2019 and 2020 rather than an underlying
    long-term decrease. Despite some variations from year to year, the turbidity
    levels we have consistently measured at Hyla Woods Creek have reliably
    remained at a safe level that fully supports the health and well-being of
    salmon populations. Our testing confirms that the turbidity at this location
    continues to be well within the optimal range for these fish.

    The dissolved oxygen (DO) level observed at Hyla Woods was 9 parts per
    million (ppm). The adequate range for salmon health according to scientific
    research is between 8-12 ppm, with higher DO concentrations being
    preferable. At 9 ppm, the data point collected falls comfortably in the
    middle of this established range. This indicates that the salmon present
    will have sufficient oxygen available to carry out vital metabolic processes
    such as processing food intake for energy and building new cells, ensuring
    their overall health and viability. The average DO level measured over the
    period from Fall 2016 to Fall 2023 was calculated to be 9.493915719 ppm. The
    data point of 9 ppm collected this year is slightly lower than this
    long-term mean, though still well within the ideal range for maintaining
    salmonid health and productivity. No discernible trends are evident from
    analyzing the DO data collected annually over the past several years, which
    instead appears to fluctuate within a relatively narrow band without any
    consistent increases or decreases. The DO levels observed at Hyla Woods have
    consistently remained at levels deemed safe to support salmon according to
    scientific consensus. Continued monitoring of this parameter is prudent to
    confirm conditions remain suitable going forward. However, given the data
    point gathered is in the middle of the optimal range and no issues have been
    identified previously, it can be reasonably concluded the water quality
    currently poses no threat to the salmon population inhabiting Hyla Woods.
    Ongoing testing will help verify this positive finding into the future.

    Based on our observations, we found that the average pH level recorded was
    6.4. It is important to note that when it comes to the health of salmon, a
    pH range of 6.0 to 8.0 is considered adequate. However, a pH level around
    7.0 is generally regarded as optimal for their well-being. Taking this into
    consideration, it can be concluded that the recorded data point of 6.4
    comfortably falls within the recommended range for salmon health. Although
    slightly acidic, it still remains within an acceptable parameter and should
    not pose any significant concerns for their overall welfare. This
    information suggests that the salmon will be carefully maintained at an
    optimal pH level. By doing so, it ensures that there will be no interference
    with the essential biochemical reactions occurring within the aquatic
    ecosystem. This is crucial as it prevents any potential harm or mortality of
    other aquatic organisms present in the environment. Throughout the time
    period from Fall 2016 to Fall 2023, the average water temperature has been
    calculated to be 6.454569129. It is worth noting that this year's data point
    of 6.4 is slightly lower than the average. However, it is important to
    highlight that this deviation is negligible and does not pose any
    significant concerns for the health and well-being of salmonid species. The
    recorded temperature still falls well within the ideal range that supports
    their optimal growth and overall health. Over the course of the eight years
    that we have been visiting Hyla Woods, an interesting observation can be
    made regarding the pH value. It has remained remarkably consistent, hovering
    around 6.5. While this indicates a slightly acidic nature, it is worth
    mentioning that the pH levels at Hyla Woods have consistently remained
    within a safe range throughout our testing period. Maintaining a stable pH
    level is crucial for the overall health and well-being of ecosystems. A
    slightly acidic pH can be attributed to various factors such as soil
    composition, vegetation types, and other environmental factors specific to
    Hyla Woods. Despite this slight acidity, there is no cause for significant
    concern as it falls within acceptable limits. The fact that these levels
    have remained relatively unchanged over an extended period of time showcases
    the stability and resilience of Hyla Woods' ecosystem. This consistency also
    suggests that the natural processes occurring within this environment are
    effectively maintaining a balanced pH level. It is important to continue
    monitoring these pH levels periodically to ensure they do not deviate
    significantly from their current state. By doing so, we can gain further
    insights into how Hyla Woods' ecological system is evolving and respond
    accordingly if any changes are observed in order to maintain its long-term
    sustainability.

    Based on our observations, the average Biotic Index that we recorded was
    determined to be 3.76. It is important to note that for optimal salmon
    health, the recommended range for the Biotic Index is below 5. In
    particular, lower Biotic Indices, such as those below 3. 75, are considered
    more favorable in terms of maintaining excellent salmon health. Taking this
    into consideration, it is worth highlighting that the data point we analyzed
    falls comfortably within this recommended range. Although it deviates
    slightly from being classified as an excellent value, it remains an
    extremely close approximation and indicates a very positive level of
    environmental quality for salmon habitat.These findings strongly suggest
    that the creek ecosystem is in a notably robust state, as the presence of
    these creatures indicates an environment that supports their survival. This
    is particularly significant because these organisms are highly sensitive to
    adverse conditions, and their thriving presence implies favorable conditions
    within the creek. It is noteworthy to mention that over the span of time
    from Fall 2016 to Fall 2023, the average Biotic Index stands at a
    commendable 3.934791769. This index serves as an important measure of
    overall ecological health and further confirms the positive state of the
    creek's ecosystem during this period. The data point for this year, which
    stands at 3.76, shows a slight decrease compared to the average value. This
    decrease indicates that the overall tolerance of macroinvertebrates has
    decreased, which can be considered a positive outcome in terms of
    environmental health. It is worth noting that this value does not exhibit
    any discernible trends and appears to fluctuate without any specific pattern
    or reason. The Biotic Index, which is a measure of the overall ecological
    health and diversity of an ecosystem, has consistently demonstrated positive
    results at Hyla Woods. The index has maintained a commendable level,
    indicating a thriving and well-balanced environment. Moreover, our ongoing
    monitoring efforts reaffirm that the ecosystem's health remains at an
    excellent level, ensuring the sustainability of its various components. This
    bodes well for the continued success and preservation of Hyla Woods'
    biodiversity in the long term.

    Based on our observations, the average EPT Score that we have encountered is
    60. 1. It is important to note that when it comes to assessing the health of
    salmon, an adequate range for their well-being is considered to be greater
    than 50. In this case, a higher EPT Score indicates better health for the
    salmon. Hence, this particular data point aligns well within the acceptable
    range and showcases positive results in terms of salmon health assessment.
    The presence of these three sensitive creatures in the creek is a strong
    indication of its overall health and vitality. It suggests that the
    conditions in the creek are favorable and able to support the survival of
    these creatures, which are known to be highly sensitive to changes in their
    environment. This is an encouraging sign, as it indicates that the creek has
    maintained a relatively stable and healthy ecosystem. Furthermore, when
    examining the average EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) Score
    over a significant period of time from Fall 2016 to Fall 2023, it was found
    to be 66.42715661. The EPT Score is widely used as an indicator of water
    quality and ecological integrity in aquatic ecosystems. This score
    represents a moderate to good quality rating for the creek. By considering
    both the presence of sensitive creatures and the EPT Score, we can conclude
    that the overall condition of this creek is quite healthy. These findings
    provide valuable insights into its ecological well-being and serve as
    evidence that efforts made towards maintaining water quality have been
    successful thus far. The data point recorded this year, which stands at
    60.1, is slightly lower than the average value. However, it is important to
    note that this deviation should not be a cause for concern as this
    particular data point falls well within the ideal range for maintaining
    optimal health in salmonid populations. It indicates that the overall health
    and well-being of the salmonid species are still being adequately
    maintained, and there is no immediate need for intervention or adjustment in
    their care or environment. The value dropped a fair bit from 2020 to 2022,
    and appears to be staying this way. This indicates that some factor may have
    influenced the creek during this time period, but since all of the other
    variables stayed constant, this may just have been a result of error in the
    data. The EPT at Hyla Woods has been at an excellent level for the time we
    have tested there, and continues to do so.

    The consistent positive scores across various measures indicate that the
    steam's health is not only currently in a good state but also has the
    potential to sustain its well-being in the long term. The absence of any
    significant negative trends suggests that the ecosystem within the steam is
    resilient and capable of maintaining its ecological balance. The findings
    from Hyla Woods and this paper provide a comprehensive understanding of the
    steam's health by considering multiple factors such as water quality,
    biodiversity, and overall ecosystem dynamics. The excellent scores obtained
    in these assessments highlight the effectiveness of conservation efforts and
    management practices implemented within the steam. Moreover, it is worth
    noting that stable or slightly fluctuating values indicate a certain level
    of equilibrium within the stream's ecosystem. However, it is important to
    acknowledge that continuous monitoring and periodic reassessment are crucial
    to ensure that any potential negative trends are promptly identified and
    addressed. Overall, we can be confident in saying that, for the time being,
    Hyla Woods and Lousignont Creek are healthy and thriving, and will hopefully
    become great homes for the next generation of salmon.
