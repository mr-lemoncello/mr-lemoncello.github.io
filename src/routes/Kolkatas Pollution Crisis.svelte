    In 2024, I had the opportunity to visit Kolkata, a city of historical,
    cultural, and personal significance. I was only there for a brief 48 hours.
    In those precious hours, I met with relatives for the first time, relatives
    I had not met in nearly a decade, and dying relatives who I will likely
    never meet again. But additionally, I found myself in a rather curious
    position: I was also deeply immersed in the mundane but critical task of
    analyzing the chemistry of pollution.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Kolkata certainly presents the strange juxtaposition of vibrant streets with
    a past of revolutionaries, poets, and intellectuals and the harsh reality of
    an over-industrialized city facing the long-term consequences of rapid
    urbanization. While exploring, I was surrounded by the signs of a city
    struggling with air and water contamination. While the very reason I was
    taking the trip was the death of my grandfather (and his return to the
    sacred Ganga), I was also tasked with examining the ever-important chemicals
    that cloud the air and poison the waters we depend on.

    This report (which would be more aptly classified as a meta-analysis), comes
    not only from the perspective of a researcher examining pollutants, but also
    from someone deeply cognizant of the city’s past and present, and the
    delicate balance of heritage, progress, and environmental stewardship,
    someone with a ‘stake in the game,’ if you will. With that in mind, let us
    turn to the chemistry of pollution in Kolkata: the chemical nature of these
    pollutants, their sources, and their environmental and health impacts.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) is a city of immense historical significance in
    India, having served as the capital of British India until 1911. Founded in
    1690 by the British East India Company, it became a major center for trade
    and colonial administration. Over the 19th and early 20th centuries, Kolkata
    was at the heart of India’s intellectual and cultural renaissance, fostering
    revolutionary ideas, social reform, and artistic movements. Figures like
    Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda, and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar helped
    shape a modern Indian identity that blended tradition and Western
    influences.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    The city was also a focal point for political resistance against British
    rule. Kolkata was home to several key revolutionary groups, such as the
    Anushilan Samiti, who launched acts of defiance against the British. The
    iconic Coffee House on College Street became a gathering place for
    intellectuals and left-wing activists, where debates on Marxism,
    nationalism, and politics were held regularly, and essentially the staging
    ground for the entire revolution in the late 19th Century. This café culture
    in Kolkata’s intellectual life was emblematic of the city’s role in shaping
    India’s political consciousness during the struggle for independence.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    After independence, Kolkata continued to be a center of political and
    cultural activity. The city became the stronghold of the Indian Communist
    movement and was the site of significant left-wing activism, including the
    Naxalite insurgency of the 1960s. Despite economic challenges in the
    post-colonial period, Kolkata remains a vibrant cultural hub, known for its
    literary heritage, cinema, and festivals like Durga Puja. Today, it balances
    its colonial past with a rich legacy of social reform, political engagement,
    and artistic expression.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Kolkata is renowned for its cultural heritage, vibrant arts scene, and
    colonial-era architecture. In the early 1900s, textile and jute factories
    led the city through a phase of rapid industrial development which also
    spurred the establishment of supporting infrastructure such as the rail
    transport systems, and communication infrastructure like the telegraph. It
    has since grown rapidly to become the 3rd most populated city in India. This
    rapid urbanization and industrialization in recent decades have led to
    significant environmental challenges, particularly in terms of pollution.<sup

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8">
    As one of India’s most industrialized cities, Kolkata faces serious issues
    with air and water contamination, which have adverse effects on public
    health and the environment. The primary sources of these pollutants include
    vehicular emissions, industrial discharges, untreated sewage, and
    agricultural runoff. From a chemistry standpoint, pollution in Kolkata is
    driven by a variety of hazardous chemical substances, all of which pose
    significant risks to both human and ecological health.

    Air pollution in Kolkata is one incredibly important, yet often overlooked
    public health issue. When in Kolkata, all you have to do is look up to
    notice the many contaminants in the air. The aforementioned
    industrialization and population density, combined with the many vehicles on
    the streets, the many factories and coal power plants, as well as frequent
    biomass/coal burning for cooking, all comes together to cause an atmosphere
    dangerous to everyone who lives there.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Particulate matter, especially PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particles smaller than 2.5
    micrometers) and PM<sub>10</sub> (particles smaller than 10 micrometers),
    constitute a lot of the pollutants in Kolkata’s air. These fine particles,
    also known as aerosols, are dangerous for many reasons. In European Union
    countries, PM<sub>2.5</sub> decreased the average life span by 8.6 months
    and the chance of respiratory mortality increased by 0.58% for every 10 µg/m<sup

    >
    increase of PM<sub>10</sub>. Individuals with higher exposure have a 9%
    greater risk of death from cardiovascular causes, and the confidence
    intervals indicate the risk could range from no increase to 18% higher. A 10
    μg/m<sup>3</sup>
    increase in PM<sup>2.5</sup>
    exposure was associated with a 1.11 times higher risk of lung cancer mortality
    and a 1.08 times higher risk of lung cancer incidence with confidence intervals
    that indicate the risk could range from 3% to 18% higher. PM<sub>2.5</sub>
    and PM<sub>10</sub> are primarily released from industrial activities and
    construction. The total amount of PM<sub>2.5</sub> released in 2018 was
    88,250 tons, about 630 times higher than the baseline set by the Oregon
    Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) of 140 tons annually, and the
    total amount of PM<sub>10</sub> was 134,750 tons, nearly 1500 times higher
    than the PM10 baseline of 90 tons.<sup>1,3,4,5,6,7</sup>
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    The chemical makeup of particulate matter in Kolkata is varied. It includes
    sulfates, which are formed from the oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub
        >2</sub
    >), mainly emitted from coal combustion and diesel-powered vehicles. The
    total amount of SO<sub>2</sub> released in 2018 was 10,400 tons, over 26
    times higher than the DEQ’s SO<sub>2</sub> baseline of 390 tons. Similarly,
    particulate matter also contains nitrates, which result from the reaction of
    nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) with atmospheric oxygen and water vapor. NO<sub
        >x</sub
    >
    is produced primarily by motor vehicles. The total amount of NO<sub>x</sub>
    in 2018 was 143,650 tons, almost 370 times higher than the DEQ’s NO<sub
        >x</sub
    >
    baseline of 390 tons. Additionally, it contains Organic Carbon (OC), which is
    produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biomass/coal burning,
    and the smoking of tobacco, the total of which in 2018 was 15,400 tons; as well
    as Elemental Carbon (EC), commonly known as black carbon and emitted from diesel
    engines and coal power plants, the total of which in 2018 was 12,900 tons. The
    presence of these chemicals in the atmosphere makes particulate matter a dangerous
    component of air pollution, leading to the aforementioned medical issues.<sup

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    There also exists several toxic gasses in Kolkata's air, with significant
    health implications for its residents, the first of which is the
    aforementioned sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). Sulfur dioxide is produced
    by the combustion of sulfur-containing fuels, such as coal and petroleum.
    Power plants, factories, and vehicle emissions are major sources of SO<sub>
        2</sub

    formation of acid rain, which harms ecosystems and buildings.<sup>5</sup>
    The chemical formula for the formation of acid rain is 2SO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Nitrogen oxides, which include nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and nitric
    oxide (NO), are primarily emitted by vehicles and power plants. These
    chemicals are not inherently dangerous by themselves, but NO<sub>2</sub>
    is a product in the formation of ozone, the chemical formula of which is NO<sub

    + VOCs [see below] + sunlight → O<sub>3</sub>. Ground-level ozone is a
    harmful oxidant, as a 10 ppb increase in ozone leads to a 4% increase in
    respiratory mortality, and ozone also increases risk of asthma by 10%. The
    total amount of NO<sub>x</sub> in 2018 was 143,650 tons, almost 370 times

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    The third and last gas present in Kolkata’s air is carbon monoxide produced
    by the incomplete combustion of fuels, particularly from motor vehicles and

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a class of chemicals that can easily
    evaporate into the air, contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone
    and smog. Major sources of VOCs include vehicle emissions, paint, solvents,
    and biomass/coal burning. Examples include benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub

    common VOCs found in the air. Long-term exposure to VOCs contributed to a
    lifetime cancer risk affecting between 0.60 million to 0.85 million

    Ammonia is released primarily from agricultural activities, including the
    use of nitrogenous fertilizers. NH<sub>3</sub> is also emitted from
    wastewater treatment plants and the decomposition of organic waste. Ammonia
    in the air can react with sulfuric and nitric acids to form particulate the
    secondary aerosol of ammonium salts, which contribute to fine particulate
    matter in the air and exacerbate air pollution.

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Lastly, Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and
    is released into the atmosphere in smoke, from cigarettes, wildfires, and
    other causes, as well as the burning of coal. BaP is a Group I carcinogenic
    agent (matter that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
    has classified as carcinogenic to humans, including substances like asbestos
    and tobacco) that is proven to increase the probability of lung cancer, skin
    cancer, and other forms of cancer by 11%. According to a study from the
    Asian Journal of Chemistry, the average BaP level in Kolkata’s air between
    1999 and 2011 was 29.82 ng/m<sub>3</sub>, a bit less than 30 times than the
    EU’s guideline of 1 ng/m<sub>3</sub> of BaP in the atmosphere.<sup

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Another thing to consider with air pollution, specifically in Kolkata, is
    temperature. The year-round average for Kolkata in 2023 was 82.6°F, which is
    very, very high. Air pollution levels spike when temperatures rise. High
    temperatures can lead to more frequent droughts and more intense wildfires,
    both of which increase particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>
    and PM<sub>2.5</sub>). Fires also release large amounts of EC, NO<sub>x</sub
    >, CO and VOCs. Heat also accelerates biological processes responsible for
    the degradation of organic waste and wastewater, releasing both air
    pollutants and greenhouse gases into the air. Warmer temperatures also
    accelerate the reactions that form ozone.<sup>25,26</sup>
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8">
    Air pollution in Kolkata presents a severe and growing public health crisis,
    driven by industrial emissions, vehicular exhaust, biomass burning, and
    other sources. The presence of harmful particulate matter, toxic gases, and
    volatile organic compounds poses significant risks to the population,
    including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, and
    increased mortality rates. The city's high levels of pollutants, far
    exceeding international environmental guidelines, exacerbate the health
    impacts on residents, with heat and temperature fluctuations further
    compounding the problem. Addressing Kolkata's air pollution requires urgent
    action to reduce emissions and mitigate the harmful effects on public health
    and the environment.

</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    You can’t talk about water pollution in Kolkata without talking about the
    Ganges. The Ganges River (and its distributaries) is the most sacred river
    in India. Hindus believe that if one consumes water from the Ganga before
    their last breath will allow them to attain Moksha and ascend to Svarga.
    However, despite its holiness, the Ganges River is the most polluted river
    in the entire world. The distributary of the Ganges that runs through
    Calcutta is known as the Hooghly River, about 100 miles north of where the
    Hooghly empties into the Bay via the Mouths of the Ganges, the focus of this
    section.<sup>28,29</sup>
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Heavy metal contamination in the Hooghly River is a serious issue.
    Industrial byproducts, particularly from battery manufacturing, mining, and
    electroplating industries, discharge heavy metals into the water. Lead (Pb)
    is a toxic metal that has caused more than 1.5 million deaths globally,
    primarily due to cardiovascular effects and was estimated to account for
    more than 33 million years lost to disability worldwide in 2021. Lead levels
    in the Hooghly were 123.3 ppb (as of 2000, newer data could not be found), 8
    times higher than the EPA Maximum Guideline of 15 ppb. Cadmium (Cd) is toxic
    to aquatic life and bioaccumulates, a threat to both animals and humans who
    consume water or seafood with cadmium as it has been associated with a
    higher likelihood of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), with some
    studies showing a notable effect at levels as low as 0.18 µg/L blood cadmium
    and 0.27 µg/g creatinine in urine. Additionally, cadmium exposure is
    significantly linked to anemia, with studies showing that increased blood
    cadmium levels are associated with higher red cell distribution width (RDW),
    indicating potential for hemolytic anemia, even after adjusting for iron
    deficiency. Cadmium as of 2000 were 28.9 ppb, nearly 6 times higher than the
    EPA Maximum Guideline of 5 ppb. Chromium (Cr) is acceptable in small
    concentrations, but in concentrations over 100 ppb (the EPA Maximum
    Guideline), hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is considered a known human
    carcinogen, with studies showing a strong association between exposure to
    high levels of Cr(VI) and increased risk of lung cancer. Chromium levels as
    of 2000 were 143.3, a concentration that is very much not healthy.<sup

</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Excessive nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), are
    commonly found in the Hooghly River. According to the EPA, an acceptable
    level of nitrogen in drinking water (measured as nitrate-nitrogen NO<sub
        >3</sub
    >N) is considered to be around 10 milligrams per liter (mg/L), which
    translates to approximately 161 µM. Mean NO<sub>3</sub>N concentrations in
    the Hooghly were 536.4±125.5 µM, four times the guidelines. The EPA
    recommends that drinking water has a phosphorus level of no more than 0.3864
    μg/m<sub>3</sub>, whereas the levels in the Hooghly were 40 μg/m<sub>3</sub
    >, roughly 100 times the acceptable baseline. The primary sources of
    nutrient pollution include untreated sewage, agricultural runoff containing
    fertilizers, and industrial discharges. High concentrations of nitrogen and
    phosphorus promote the rapid growth of algae, a process known as
    eutrophication. This leads to the depletion of oxygen in the water
    (hypoxia), causing the death of fish and other aquatic organisms, the
    chemical explanation of which is Nitrates (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) +
    Phosphates (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) → Algal Blooms → Hypoxia. This is a
    big issue in Kolkata, both in the Hooghly River and in the East Kolkata
    Wetlands.<sup>38,39,40,41,42</sup>
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Lastly, organic pollutants, including industrial chemicals, pesticides, and
    pharmaceuticals, are prevalent in the Hooghly, specifically the pesticide
    dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and a class of chemicals called PCBs
    (polychlorinated biphenyls). The WHO sets the baseline for DDT at 1 μg/L,
    whereas DDT in the Hooghly is approximately 8.97 μg/L, nearly nine times
    higher. The WHO also sets the baseline for PCBs at 10 μg/L, but the amount
    present in the Hooghly is an absolutely disappointing 1731 μg/L. These
    pollutants can have long-lasting effects on water quality and ecosystem
    health, and are not only toxic but also highly persistent in the
    environment. They accumulate in the food chain, affecting both wildlife and
    humans. Mammals exposed to DDT develop liver tumors and have an increased
    risk of liver tumors and DDT is a “likely human carcinogen” according to the
    IARC. Additionally, DDT can disrupt hormone systems and mothers who were
    exposed to DDT prior to age 14 years showed a 5-fold increase in risk of
    breast cancer. PCBs, once widely used in electrical equipment, are now
    banned but continue to pollute water bodies due to their long persistence.
    <sup>43,44,45,46,47</sup>
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8">
    The Hooghly River, a vital water source and cultural symbol in Kolkata, is
    severely threatened by multiple forms of pollution, including heavy metals,
    excessive nutrients, and organic contaminants. The levels of lead, cadmium,
    chromium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and persistent chemicals like DDT and PCBs
    far exceed internationally accepted guidelines, posing serious health risks
    to both aquatic life and humans. The river's pollution is driven by
    industrial discharge, untreated sewage, and agricultural runoff, which
    collectively contribute to the degradation of water quality, disrupt
    ecosystems, and endanger public health. Addressing these issues requires
    urgent intervention, comprehensive monitoring, and stricter enforcement of
    environmental regulations to protect both the Hooghly River and the
    communities that depend on it.

<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    Pollution in Kolkata is a multifaceted issue with significant chemical
    implications for air and water quality, with pollutants far exceeding the
    acceptable baselines set by credible environmental organizations like the
    EPA or the UN. The primary sources of pollutants in the city: industrial
    activities, vehicular emissions, agricultural practices, and untreated
    sewage release a range of harmful chemicals into the environment. The vast
    array of pollutants pose severe health risks, from respiratory and
    cardiovascular diseases to neurological disorders and cancer.
</p>
<p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">
    There are a large amount of potential solutions to the pollution crisis in
    the region: shifting to cleaner fuels like green energy, robust
    implementation of pollution control plans, banning waste burning, improving
    sewage treatment, promoting awareness campaigns, and strictly enforcing
    emission norms for vehicles, all while monitoring air quality regularly to
    identify pollution hotspots. Effective pollution interventions include
    upgrading and expanding mass transit systems, reducing sulfur content in
    fuel, converting coal-fired power plants to natural gas, and redesigning
    urban areas to promote walkable communities. There really isn’t a satisfying
    be-all end-all solution to air or water pollution, and the only way these
    problems will be solved is through a multifaceted, systematic effort to
    improve society as a whole. Only through such collective action can Kolkata
    hope to mitigate the damaging effects of pollution and ensure a healthier,
    more sustainable future for its residents and the environment.
