    ourselves, our nature, and our societies. But what happens when a novel
    disguises personal pessimism as universal insight? Lord of the Flies is
    hailed as an explanation of human nature, a text that reveals our ‘inherent
    savagery’, but this reverence deserves closer scrutiny. Given the
    improbability of a group of people so quickly descending into violence and
    that Golding projects his own flaws onto the boys on the island, it is
    surprising it is thought of as a must-read because it ought not to be.</p> <p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 mb-0">One major criticism of the novel is the improbability of a group of children
    raised in a society so quickly descending into violence and chaos without an
    imminent, life-threatening danger; such an unraveling oversimplifies the
    complexity of human nature. The closest real-life scenario we have to Lord
    of the Flies’ result was antithetical to it: Mano Totao and five Tongan
    teenagers who, in 1965, set out on a fishing trip and were stranded on a
    deserted island after being caught in a typhoon.<sup>1</sup> This is similar to Golding’s boys, who arrive on the island via plane crash,
    leaving both sets of boys wrecked and left to survive on their own. Golding’s
    boys fully descend into chaos: “The rock struck Piggy a glancing blow from chin
    to knee; the conch exploded into a thousand white fragments and ceased to exist”
    (181). Literally, this marks the destruction of Piggy and the conch, but symbolically,
    it represents the end of civilization and the shift in power from morality to
    barbarity. In contrast, the Tongan boys cooperated to build a functional community,
    surviving for fifteen months. It’s important to note that they were friends beforehand,
    but this does not fully account for their success. Golding’s boys had several
    months on the island to form alliances and relationships, and did so. Friendship
    alone can not explain the Tongan boys’ achievements: they didn’t just avoid violence,
    they created systems: tending to each other’s injuries, growing vegetables, raising
    chickens, building rainwater storage, a gym, and a permanent fire, all of which
    is impossible without shared vision and an ethic of care. As Totao put it, “our
    secret superpower is our ability to cooperate.” Both are microcosmic: Golding
    depicts morality crumbling in isolation, but a real scenario under similar conditions
    suggests that humanity persists and thrives. One could even say that living within
    society is worse. At very young ages, humans are altruistic<sup>2</sup> and egalitarian, sharing resources,<sup>3</sup> whether or not they were obtained in collaboration. <sup>4</sup> After many years of society’s training, humans grow complacent.
    In 1961, the Milgram Experiment showed that 64% of participants would
    deliver multiple lethal shocks to an unconscious body because a scientist
    told them to. <sup>5</sup> In 1971, a group of college students were placed in a simulated
    prison environment, and the ‘guards’ became so abusive, the experiment was
    cut short.<sup>6</sup> The concept is not limited to experiments: the Abu
    Ghraib prison guards committed physical and sexual abuse, rape, and murder
    against inmates.<sup>7</sup> Their inherent nature did not strictly shape these
    individuals’ behavior, rather, the societal pressures of obedience and conformity
    that undermine innate altruistic tendencies did. Golding’s portrayal of human
    nature is a cautionary tale, but the Tongan castaways suggest that cooperation,
    not chaos, is the more likely outcome of adversity, and other examples suggest
    chaos forms more often within society than not.</p> <p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">While reality has since indicated the novel is unrealistic, what is more
    interesting is why it takes this stance. The most compelling idea is that
    Golding projects his own flaws onto the boys on the island. Some key moments
    bear resemblance to moments in his life: he had an unhappy childhood, was an
    alcoholic, prone to depression, miserable, angry, and misanthropic. He
    himself said there was a “monstrous” side to his character, admitted to
    being pleased when a schoolfriend died, and said a fourteen-year old girl
    was “depraved by nature… already as sexy as an ape,” and then he tried to
    rape her. <sup>8,9</sup> This reflects the novel; in an appalling example of behavior,
    Roger rapes a sow with the other hunters’ full support: “The hunters
    followed, wedded to her in lust… Robert stabilized the thing in a phrase
    which was received uproariously. ‘Right up her ass!’” (135). His comments
    show a disturbing view of acceptable behavior, especially as this appears in
    his own memoir. Jack’s tribe, and especially some of his speeches, are close
    to those of Adolf Hitler. Jack delivers a speech: “Listen, all of you. Me
    and my hunters, we’re living along the beach by a flat rock. We hunt and
    feast and have fun. If you want to join my tribe come and see us. Perhaps
    I’ll let you join. Perhaps not” (140), shockingly similar to the early
    rhetoric of Hitler, specifically Munich, 12 April 1921, where Hitler called
    for an Aryan state and the exclusion of those he considered outsiders:
    “There are only two possibilities: either victory of the Aryan, or
    annihilation of the Aryan and the victory of the Jew.”<sup>10</sup> Consider
    that Golding thought he could have been a Nazi if he was in Germany: “I have
    always understood the Nazis because I am of that sort by nature”, and added that
    “that sad self-knowledge” inspired his novel. His admission reveals that he is
    not simply telling a story but using the boys on the island as a projection.
    Given these key moments bear such close resemblance to his own experiences, it
    is not a stretch to conclude he is personifying his own warped views of society
    through the tribe.</p> <p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">The reason for the novel’s perspectives are now clear, but what is more is
    that it is thought of as a must-read, and it ought not to be. It is
    critically acclaimed, one reason why it has stayed relevant for so many
    years. Modern Library ranks it the 41st best novel on the Editor’s List<sup>11</sup> and 25th best on the Reader’s List;<sup>12</sup> additionally, the BBC
    survey, the Big Read ranks it 70th best<sup>13</sup> and Time Magazine ranks
    it 7th best.<sup>14</sup> Portland Public Schools has said, “It is nearly
    impossible to be considered an educated individual, and not have at least a
    rudimentary understanding of this classic work.”<sup>15</sup> Renowned institutions. magazines, and education systems alike have hailed this
    as a classic, and yet, the portrayal of human nature is overly simplistic and
    ultimately misleading. While it asserts that savagery is a part of humanity seen
    when removed from society, this is a bleak and narrow interpretation. Simon’s
    chilling revelation, “Maybe there is a beast… maybe it's only us” (106-107),
    is an example of Golding’s belief that violence is an individual trait. However,
    this overlooks the fact that human rights is a relatively new concept. Violence
    is not so much inherent to individuals but a result of what society deems acceptable,<sup>16</sup> and frequently, it is not individuals, but societal pressures that make those
    choices. Somehow we are inches away from moving into barbarity, the systems of
    society the only thing holding us together; in reality, humans in isolation are
    altruistic and the systems of society dampen that. That is not to say that it
    is not a good read, just that it is not important enough of a read to warrant
    such universal attention.</p> <p class="text-white font-mono text-sm indent-8 m-0 pt-0">While Lord of the Flies has edged its way into the literary canon thus far,
    it deserves more a critical eye than continued reverence. Its portrayal of
    human nature is not just wrong but completely opposite reality. Golding’s
    own life and demons bleed into it, making it less universal truth than a
    projection of his psyche. Its continued prominence says more about the
    institutions that hold it up than its actual merit. Rather than accepting
    this unquestioned classic, perhaps we should reevaluate the stories we
    choose to elevate and why we choose to do so, especially when these works
    make such broad statements about what it means to be human.</p> <hr/> <p class="text-white font-mono text-sm m-0 pt-0"><sup>1. Bregman, Rutger. Humankind: A Hopeful History. Bloomsbury
